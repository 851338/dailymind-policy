    Privacy Policy for DailyMind
Last updated: June 25, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes how DailyMind ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use the DailyMind mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our practices.
1. Information We Collect
We collect information to provide and improve the App's features and your experience. The types of information we collect depend on how you use the App:
Account Information: When you create an account, we collect information you provide, such as your email address, display name, and profile picture (if you sign up using Google). We also receive and store your unique Firebase User ID (UID) which is used to identify your account and data.
Journal Entry Data: When you create journal entries, we collect the text content you write, the timestamp of the entry, the mood value you select, and any AI-generated sentiment analysis results associated with the entry.
Mood Data: When you track your mood, we collect the mood value you select and the associated timestamp.
Usage Data: We may collect information about how you access and use the App, such as the features you use, the frequency and duration of your sessions, and interactions with different parts of the App. This is typically collected through third-party analytics services like Firebase Analytics.
Device Information: We may collect information about the device you use to access the App, including the device model, operating system, app version, and unique device identifiers. This helps us with compatibility and troubleshooting.
In-App Purchase Information: If you make a premium purchase, transaction details are handled by Google Play Store or Apple App Store. We receive confirmation of your purchase status to unlock premium features but do not directly process or store your payment card information. We may store your purchase history or entitlement status in your account data (e.g., in Firestore).
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect primarily to:
Provide and maintain the App's functionality: This includes allowing you to create, save, edit, and view your journal entries and mood data; syncing your data across your devices; providing the Pomodoro timer and calm zone features; and ensuring the App operates correctly.
Personalize your experience: We use your journal entry data, including text and mood, to provide personalized insights such as mood trends, AI sentiment analysis results, and AI-generated affirmations and suggestions.
Improve and optimize the App: We use usage data to understand how the App is used, identify areas for improvement, and fix bugs.
Communicate with you: We may use your account information to respond to your inquiries or provide important updates about the App.
Process transactions: We use information to process your in-app purchases and manage your premium access.
Crucially, regarding your Journal Entry Data: The content of your journal entries (text, mood, sentiment) is treated as private personal data. It is used solely to provide the core journaling features, analytics, and AI-powered insights within the App for your personal benefit. We do not access, read, or use the content of your journal entries for marketing purposes, share them with advertisers, or make them publicly available.
3. Data Storage and Security
Local Storage (Hive): Your journal entries and some settings are stored locally on your device using Hive. This allows for offline access and quick retrieval.
Cloud Storage (Firebase Firestore): Your journal entries and account information are also stored securely in Google Firebase Firestore. This enables syncing your data across multiple devices and provides a backup.
Security Measures: We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data stored in Firebase Firestore, including Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules designed to ensure that only you can access your journal data associated with your account. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
4. Third-Party Services
We use third-party services to provide certain functionalities. These third parties may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.
Firebase (Google): Used for authentication, cloud storage (Firestore), analytics (Firebase Analytics - if enabled), and crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics - if enabled). See Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Google AI (Gemini API): Used for processing journal text for sentiment analysis and generating affirmations/suggestions. The text is sent to this API for processing. See Google's terms related to AI: https://policies.google.com/terms/service-terms (Find relevant sections on AI/Machine Learning).
Google Sign-In (Google): Used to facilitate account creation and login using your Google account. See Google's Privacy Policy.
Google Play Store / Apple App Store: Handle the processing of in-app purchases. Refer to Google Play's and Apple App Store's privacy policies for details on how they handle payment information.
Audioplayers / Flutter TTS / Charts Flutter / Hive / Provider / Path Provider / Intl / Speech To Text / Flutter Native Timezone / Timezone / Connectivity Plus / PDF / Printing / URL Launcher / In App Purchase: These are Flutter packages used for various functionalities. Review their documentation and dependencies for information on data handling, though most of these do not collect significant personal data themselves.
5. Your Rights
You have certain rights regarding your personal data. These may include:
Access: Request access to the personal data we hold about you.
Rectification: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
Erasure: Request deletion of your personal data. You can delete individual journal entries within the App. For account deletion and all associated data, please contact us using the information below.
Object: Object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
Data Portability: Request a copy of your data in a structured, machine-readable format (e.g., via the PDF export feature for your entries).
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
6. Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for use by children under the age of [e.g., 13 or 16, depending on your target region and laws like COPPA or GDPR]. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so that we can take necessary steps to remove that information.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page [and potentially through an in-app notification]. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
