  <h1>Privacy Policy for DailyMind</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 25, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how DailyMind ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use the DailyMind mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our practices.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information to provide and improve the App's features and your experience. The types of information we collect depend on how you use the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect information you provide, such as your email address, display name, and profile picture (if you sign up using Google). We also receive and store your unique Firebase User ID (UID) which is used to identify your account and data.</li>
    <li><strong>Journal Entry Data:</strong> When you create journal entries, we collect the text content you write, the timestamp of the entry, the mood value you select, and any AI-generated sentiment analysis results associated with the entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Mood Data:</strong> When you track your mood, we collect the mood value you select and the associated timestamp.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information about how you access and use the App, such as the features you use, the frequency and duration of your sessions, and interactions with different parts of the App. This is typically collected through third-party analytics services like Firebase Analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about the device you use to access the App, including the device model, operating system, app version, and unique device identifiers. This helps us with compatibility and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>In-App Purchase Information:</strong> If you make a premium purchase, transaction details are handled by Google Play Store or Apple App Store. We receive confirmation of your purchase status to unlock premium features but do not directly process or store your payment card information. We may store your purchase history or entitlement status in your account data (e.g., in Firestore).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect primarily to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and maintain the App's functionality:</strong> This includes allowing you to create, save, edit, and view your journal entries and mood data; syncing your data across your devices; providing the Pomodoro timer and calm zone features; and ensuring the App operates correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalize your experience:</strong> We use your journal entry data, including text and mood, to provide personalized insights such as mood trends, AI sentiment analysis results, and AI-generated affirmations and suggestions.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve and optimize the App:</strong> We use usage data to understand how the App is used, identify areas for improvement, and fix bugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate with you:</strong> We may use your account information to respond to your inquiries or provide important updates about the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Process transactions:</strong> We use information to process your in-app purchases and manage your premium access.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Crucially, regarding your Journal Entry Data:</strong> The content of your journal entries (text, mood, sentiment) is treated as private personal data. It is used solely to provide the core journaling features, analytics, and AI-powered insights within the App for your personal benefit. We do not access, read, or use the content of your journal entries for marketing purposes, share them with advertisers, or make them publicly available.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage (Hive):</strong> Your journal entries and some settings are stored locally on your device using Hive. This allows for offline access and quick retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Storage (Firebase Firestore):</strong> Your journal entries and account information are also stored securely in Google Firebase Firestore. This enables syncing your data across multiple devices and provides a backup.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data stored in Firebase Firestore, including Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules designed to ensure that only you can access your journal data associated with your account. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
